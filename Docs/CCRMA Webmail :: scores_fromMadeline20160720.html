Hi Takako,

Attached are the scores. Apologies for any part of the web of detective
work on this I may have caused. I feel compelled to help demystify a
bit... if Chryssie does the same, I hope our accounts will confirm each
other!

This is my understanding of how the system was supposed to work. The
experimenter had two settings at the top level Max patch. The drop-down
on the left determined which set of scores score would be played by the
human pair and the human/computer duet (the first AA/BC pair on the
attached scores, or the second pair). The drop-down on the right
determined if the AA blocks or the BC blocks would be run first (Block
Order 1, Block Order 2, respectively) in each part of the experiment
(Human1/Max2, Human1/Human2, or Human2/Max1, each 4 blocks).

Then, the order of which player would play first for each part was
determined 'randomly' by picking one of the 'order_*' files (selecting
from order_1* if Block Order 1 was set, or order_2* if Block Order 2 was
set). The eight files in each order_1* and order_2* set represented the
eight possibilities that in each of the three 4-block sets, either
player 1 or player 2 could start. These mappings are as follows:

*Which player played first?*
Order 	Human 1/Max 2 	Human 1/Human 2 	Max 1/Human 2
order_*A 	1 	1 	1
order_*B 	1 	1 	2
order_*C 	1 	2 	1
order_*D 	1 	2 	2
order_*E 	2 	1 	1
order_*F 	2 	1 	2
order_*G 	2 	2 	1
order_*H 	2 	2 	2


Thus at this point, the block order for the entire experiment (12
blocks, corresponding to the 12 numbers listed in the second column of
each of the order_* files) was effectively determined. A rerun of the
settings (loading a block order and clicking through the block labels
that came up in the screen shot below) confirmed the following original
mapping of numbers to stimulus type:

(I've changed odd/even to first/second below - I think its easier to
understand!)
1: Player 1 first - AA - Human 1/Max 2
2: Player 1 second - AA - Human 1/Max 2
3: Player 1 first - BC - Human 1/Max 2
4: Player 1 second - BC - Human 1/Max 2
5: Player 1 first - AA - Human 1/Human 2
6: Player 1 second - AA - Human 1/Human 2
7: Player 1 first - BC - Human 1/Human 2
8: Player 1 second - BC - Human 1/Human 2
9: Player 1 first - AA - Max 1/Human 2
10: Player 1 second - AA - Max 1/Human 2
11: Player 1 first - BC - Max 1/Human 2
12: Player 1 second - BC - Max 1/Human 2

Again, that is my understanding... One potential issue was if Max was
restarted, this would cause a different ordering of who plays first and
second, even if the two top-level settings were the same. Unless the
block-order.txt file (which is a saved version of the order_* file
selected at the beginning) was renamed or moved, I think would be
overwritten...

The reasoning behind randomizing the ordering (who goes first/second in
each set) was that counter-balancing two settings was thought to be
easier to manage for the experimenter rather than three, though perhaps
this should be simplified, or mistake-proofed.

Best,
Madeline
