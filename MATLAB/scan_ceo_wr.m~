% The main purpose of this program is to read in the .ceo (actually the
% middle part only - converted by 'do_store_events.sh' to the files called
% _evt.txt for each block
%
% The most sought out information is which note is deviant for each trial
% and which trial is valid or not
%
% Also we want to know how many trials are made and whether that matches
% with the number of log-files recorded by the MAX/MSP program
